This project corresponds to the Bachelor thesis of Julian Lorenz at the Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main.

It includes the implementation and documentation of the algorithms RMinimum and RMedian, presented by the research group of theoretical computer science at the Goethe-University.

Since both algorithms are independent implementations, each subfolder within the main folder contains another README.md file, providing further, more specific information.

### Directory Tree
The project uses the following directory tree:

| Folder | Contains |
| ------ | ------ |
| *LaTeX* | Contains the written bachelor thesis as *.pdf* document |
| *RMedian* | Contains the implementation, data and test cases of RMedian |
| *RMinimum* | Contains the implementation, data and test cases of RMinimum |
| *Tools* | Contains all code snippets used to help during the process |
