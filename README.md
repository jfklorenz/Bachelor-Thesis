# Bachelor Thesis

This project corresponds to the bachelor thesis in computer science of Julian Lorenz at the Goethe-University, Frankfurt am Main 2020.

It includes the implementation and documentation of the algorithms RMinimum and RMedian, presented by the research group of theoretical computer science at the Goethe-University.

Both algorithm can to a certain degree control the amount of comparisons specific elements take part in the process, the so called fragile complexity.
